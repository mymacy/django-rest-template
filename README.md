# django-rest-template
This is a basic Django template for App/Website API Backends.

WARNING: This is very much WIP.

It is meant to be used with a simple NGINX + Gunicorn backend running on Ubuntu.
Process management is done with supervisor.

Django also serves the index.html file for SPA frontends like React, Angular and Vue. Feel free to check out my Vue template which works great with this one.

XXXXXXXXXXX is the project name which should be replaced with the actual app name in various places.
The example project gives some options to play around with. (Ignore the title and URL Check field)

I am a beginner and created this template with the help of many tutorials. I use it as a reminder and to have a nice starting point for new projects. If you would like to use this template feel free to do so.

Ideas for improvement are very welcome!
